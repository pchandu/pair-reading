# pair-reading
How often do you pick up a book and never end up finishing it? Too often in our case. Pair Reading is a web application built with the MERN stack to help people find the accountability they need to finish their books by finding users reading partners on books they're interested in. 

Check out our live demo here: https://pair-reading.herokuapp.com/#/

The PairReading journey begins upon signup, where users are taken to the onboarding page to select their preferences: the time of day that works best to meet with their pair and the books they're interested in pairing with. The preferences are stylized buttons that change color to indicate whether they are selected or not.
